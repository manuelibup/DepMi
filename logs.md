## Session 1 — Feb 26, 2026 (Pre-dawn)
**Agent:** Google Gemini (via previous conversation)  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:
- **Manuel** defined the full DepMi vision, brand identity, financial model, and 6-week MVP roadmap in `agent.md`
- **Gemini** created the strategic analysis and implementation plan (`implementation_plan.md.resolved`) — tech stack recommendations, data architecture, escrow-over-wallet model, and the 6-week roadmap refinement
- **Gemini** scaffolded the Next.js 16 web app (`web/`) with:
  - `page.tsx` — Single-file social feed with a Demand Card, Product Card, filter bar, and bottom nav
  - `page.module.css` — 344-line stylesheet for the feed layout
  - `globals.css` — CSS variables, DM Sans font, basic resets
  - `layout.tsx` — Root layout with metadata
- **Gemini** generated brand kit HTML files and logo concepts in `files/`

### Issues found (by Antigravity review):
- Corrupted emoji characters (`👟` → `�`) in 3 locations
- Manual `<head>` tag conflicting with Next.js Metadata API
- Empty `<span>` for logo (no actual logo SVG)
- Hardcoded `top: 60px` on filter bar (fragile)
- No dark mode, no hover/focus states, no interactivity
- Everything in one monolithic component with hardcoded data
- Default Next.js assets still in `/public` (vercel.svg, etc.)
- No SEO/Open Graph metadata

---

## Session 2 — Feb 26, 2026 (07:00 WAT)
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Code Review & Audit
- **Antigravity** performed a full code review of Gemini's work
- Documented 5 bugs, 6 code quality issues, and a complete UI assessment
- Created `implementation_plan.md` with proposed fixes and UI overhaul

#### Full UI Overhaul (Approved by Manuel)
- **Antigravity** rewrote `globals.css`:
  - Added dark mode via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
  - Added animation keyframes: `fadeInUp`, `slideInRight`, `pulse`, `shimmer`, `ripple`
  - Expanded design tokens: glassmorphism vars, transition easings, shadow system, gold accent

- **Antigravity** created 6 modular components (from 1 monolithic file):
  | Component | Key features |
  |-----------|-------------|
  | `Header.tsx` | SVG logo with green gradient, SVG search/bell icons, notification dot |
  | `FilterBar.tsx` | `useState` for active filter, 7 categories, hover/active transitions |
  | `StoriesBar.tsx` | Vendor story circles with gradient rings, staggered slide-in animation |
  | `DemandCard.tsx` | Typed props, bid count, urgency timer, gradient CTA, SVG share icon |
  | `ProductCard.tsx` | `next/image`, Deps tier badges, viewer count, social row (like/comment/share/save) |
  | `BottomNav.tsx` | 5-tab nav with SVG icons + labels, floating green "+" button |

- **Antigravity** fixed `layout.tsx`:
  - Removed manual `<head>` → Next.js `Metadata` + `Viewport` exports
  - Added OG title/description/siteName

- **Antigravity** rewrote `page.tsx`:
  - Clean composition of all 6 components
  - Typed mock data arrays (`DemandData[]`, `ProductData[]`)
  - Interleaved demand + product cards in the feed

- **Antigravity** generated 2 product images (sneakers, iPhone) → `/public`

#### Build Verification
- ✅ `next build` passed — Compiled in 2.6s, TypeScript clean, 4/4 static pages

### Pending:
- Visual verification by Manuel in the browser
- Iterate on feedback

---


---

## Session 3 — Feb 26, 2026 (08:00–09:00 WAT)
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:
- **Antigravity** reviewed Gemini's initial `schema.prisma` and found 7 issues
- **Antigravity** rewrote `schema.prisma` with fixes:
  - Moved `DATABASE_URL` to `prisma.config.ts` (Prisma 7 breaking change)
  - Changed `role: Role` → `roles: Role[]` for dual-role users
  - Replaced `deps: Int` with a `DepTransaction` audit table
  - Added `KycStatus` model (stores reference tokens, not raw BVN/NIN)
  - Added `ProductImage` table for product carousels
  - Added `category` + `location` fields for the Demand Engine
  - Added `@@index` on Demand and Product for query performance
- **Manuel** pushed everything to GitHub and deployed to Vercel
- **Issue:** `depmi.vercel.app` returned `404 NOT_FOUND`

---

## Session 4 — Feb 26, 2026 (08:00–22:00 WAT) — Vercel 404 Incident
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### Incident Summary: Vercel 404 Despite Successful Local Build

**Root Cause (confirmed by Manuel):** When Manuel changed the Root Directory in Vercel Settings from `/` to `web`, it **silently reset the Framework Preset from "Next.js" to "Other"**. With Framework Preset set to "Other", Vercel ran `npm run build` (so compilation succeeded), but did NOT use the Next.js serving adapter to route requests. Vercel had no idea the output was a Next.js app, so it couldn't serve any routes — resulting in 404 on every URL including `/`.

A **secondary issue** (introduced during debugging): `turbopack.root` in `next.config.ts` was conflicting with Vercel's `outputFileTracingRoot`. This was a mistake introduced while trying to fix the original problem.

**Timeline of fixes tried:**
1. Manuel set Root Directory to `web` in Vercel Settings ❌ still 404 (this is also what caused the Framework Preset to reset)
2. Deleted empty root `package-lock.json` ❌ still 404
3. Added `turbopack.root` to `next.config.ts` ❌ made it worse (new conflict)
4. Cleared build cache on redeploy ❌ still 404 on its own
5. **Changed Framework Preset from "Other" → "Next.js"** in Settings → General + **cleared build cache** ✅ **FIXED**

**The fix that worked:** Settings → General → Build & Development Settings → **Framework Preset → change from "Other" to "Next.js"** → Save → Redeploy with cache cleared.

**Build proof:**
```
✅ Detected Next.js version: 16.1.6
✅ added 427 packages in 16s
✅ Compiled successfully in 4.0s
✅ Generating static pages (4/4)
✅ Deployment completed
```

### If This Happens Again:
1. **First check:** Does the unique deployment URL also 404? If yes → it's a serving issue, not a domain issue.
2. **Go to Settings → General → Build & Development Settings** → Is **Framework Preset** set to **"Next.js"**? If it says "Other", that's the problem — change it, save, and redeploy.
3. **When changing Root Directory in Vercel, ALWAYS re-check Framework Preset immediately after saving.** Vercel silently resets it to "Other".
4. Redeploy with "Clear Build Cache" unchecked to avoid leftover artifacts.
5. **Avoid:** Never add `turbopack.root` to `next.config.ts` for Vercel deployments — Vercel manages this internally.

### What Manuel Did Wrong (and how to handle it better):
See `tips.md` → Section 5 (Deployment Debugging).

## Session 5 — Feb 26, 2026 (22:30–23:00 WAT) — Schema Restructure
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Schema Architecture Overhaul
- **Antigravity** split User (personal identity) from Store (business identity) — Facebook Pages model
- **Antigravity** added multi-provider auth via `Account` model:
  - Email + password (bcrypt, 12+ salt rounds)
  - Google OAuth
  - WhatsApp phone verification
- **Antigravity** added `KycTier` enum with 6 tiers (UNVERIFIED → BUSINESS)
- **Manuel** decided: BVN verification (TIER_2) required before creating a Store
- Products, Bids, Orders-as-seller now relate to `Store`, not `User`
- Dep scores tracked separately: buyer trust on User, seller trust on Store
- Added `Notification` model with 10 typed events
- Added `Bid.productId` — vendors can attach existing products when bidding
- Added `Order.demandId` + `Order.bidId` — full origin tracing

#### Documentation
- Updated `agent.md` with new architecture (User/Store model, auth, KYC tiers, data architecture section)
- Updated `logs.md` (this entry)
- Created `.agents/workflows/update-docs.md` — ensures all AI agents auto-update logs/tips/agent.md

#### Validations
- ✅ `prisma validate` — schema valid
- ✅ `next build` — compiles clean

---

## Session 6 — Feb 27, 2026 (17:00–18:30 WAT) — Code Quality & Design Enhancements
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Codebase & Architecture Refactoring
- **Restructured Components**: Moved all 6 components (`Header`, `FilterBar`, `StoriesBar`, `DemandCard`, `ProductCard`, `BottomNav`) into dedicated subfolders (`src/components/[Name]/index.tsx`) along with their respective `.module.css` files.
- **TypeScript Enhancements**: Added explicit prop interfaces (`DemandCardProps`, `ProductCardProps`, `FilterBarProps`) for stronger type safety.
- **Styling**: Created `src/styles/tokens.css` to centralize design tokens (`--primary`, `--card-bg-glass`, etc.) and integrated them across all CSS modules. Verified dark mode support.

#### UI & Asset Updates
- **New Logo**: Generated a new, premium monogram "DM" logo with a transparent background. 
- **Header Update**: Replaced the inline SVG in `Header.tsx` with the Next.js `<Image>` component pointing to the new DM logo.
- **Cleanup**: Removed the default Next.js `vercel.svg` asset from the `public/` directory.

#### SEO & Accessibility
- **Metadata**: Enhanced `layout.tsx` with comprehensive SEO metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, Canonical URL, and Favicon icon).
- **Accessibility**: Added `aria-labels` to all icon-only buttons in `ProductCard`, `DemandCard`, and `Header`. Added `focus-visible` styling in `globals.css` for better keyboard navigation.

#### Documentation & DX
- **Table of Contents**: Added Table of Contents to both `agent.md` and `logs.md` for easier navigation.
- **Performance Checklist**: Built a new `performance_checklist.md` artifact covering bundle size, image optimization, dynamic imports, and Web Vitals best practices.
- **Verification**: `npm run lint` passed with 0 errors.

### Pending
- Build testing via Vercel.

---

## Session 7 — Feb 27, 2026 (18:30–19:00 WAT) — Auth & Profile Scaffolding
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### User Model Updates (Prisma)
- Added `username` (unique string)
- Added `displayName` (required string)
- Added `dateOfBirth` (DateTime) to enforce Age Gating restrictions

#### NextAuth Setup
- Integrated **NextAuth.js (Auth.js)** v4 using `PrismaAdapter`.
- Configured `.env.local` to securely house JWT secrets and Google OAuth secrets.
- Configured `CredentialsProvider` to use `bcrypt` with 12 salt rounds for Password authentication.
- Configured `GoogleProvider` for seamless social sign-on.
- Configured `Providers.tsx` (`SessionProvider`) and wrapped `layout.tsx`.
- Created robust `middleware.ts` to seamlessly protect all internal routes, enforcing authentication before users can access their dashboard, while leaving `/login`, `/register`, and `/` public.

#### UI Scaffolding
- Built the new Register Page (`/register`) incorporating fields for Username, Display Name, Date of Birth, Email, and Password. Added robust client & server-side API error handling.
- Built the Login Page (`/login`) utilizing NextAuth's built-in `signIn()` logic.
- Built Modular UI components: `InputField` and `SocialLoginButton`.
- Used `zod` for strictly typing and validating form payload inputs in the Server (`/api/auth/register`).
- Applied global form styling utilizing our standard design tokens mapping (`tokens.css`).

#### Result
- Successfully completed the MVP Roadmap **Phase 1: Week 1**.
- The build passed ESLint type validations perfectly (`npm run lint` clean).

#### Known Issues at Session End (fixed in Session 8)
- `PrismaAdapter` incompatible with custom Account schema → Google OAuth would break in production.
- `name` field referenced in code but does not exist in the Prisma User schema → Prisma client type error.
- Age validation calculated by year subtraction only → off by up to 11 months.
- Missing `@types/bcrypt` dev dependency.

---

## Session 8 — Feb 27, 2026 (19:30–20:00 WAT) — Auth Code Review & Bug Fixes
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Code Review of Session 7 (Gemini) Output
- Full review of `auth.ts`, `register/route.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `login/page.tsx`, `register/page.tsx`, `Auth.module.css`, `InputField.tsx`, `SocialLoginButton.tsx`, and `schema.prisma`.

#### Bugs Fixed

**1. Critical — PrismaAdapter removed from `auth.ts`**
- The `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` expects NextAuth's standard schema format (`type String`, `providerAccountId`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, etc.). DepMi's custom `Account` model uses an `AuthProvider` enum, `providerId`, and `passwordHash` — completely incompatible.
- **Fix:** Dropped the adapter entirely. Replaced with a manual `signIn` callback that creates/links Google accounts directly using DepMi's schema (`provider: "GOOGLE"`, `providerId: account.providerAccountId`). Added a `jwt` callback that looks up the real DB user ID by email for OAuth sign-ins.

**2. Bug — `name` field doesn't exist in User schema**
- `register/route.ts` sent `name: displayName` to `prisma.user.create()` — field does not exist in the schema. Would cause a Prisma client type error once client is regenerated.
- `auth.ts` referenced `user.name` — same non-existent field.
- **Fix:** Removed `name: displayName` from create data. Changed authorize return to use `user.displayName`.

**3. Bug — Age calculation was off by up to 11 months**
- `new Date().getFullYear() - new Date(date).getFullYear()` ignores whether the birthday has passed yet in the current year. A user born Dec 31, 2013 would incorrectly pass validation today (Feb 27, 2026: 2026-2013=13, but they're actually 12).
- **Fix:** Proper age calculation accounting for month + day delta.

**4. Hint — Zod v4 deprecation**
- `z.string().email()` is deprecated in Zod v4.3.6. Updated to `z.email()`.

#### Dependency Fix
- Installed `@types/bcrypt` as devDependency (`bcrypt` had no type declarations, causing TS7016 error).

#### What Gemini did well (preserved as-is)
- bcrypt at 12 rounds, never plaintext ✅
- JWT session strategy (correct for custom schema) ✅
- Auto sign-in after registration ✅
- Separate 409 errors for email vs username conflict ✅
- Zod validation on API route ✅
- Middleware regex correctly excludes `/`, `/login`, `/register` ✅
- CSS using design tokens from `tokens.css` ✅

### Pending / Next Steps (Week 2)
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema to Neon DB.
- Week 2: KYC system (Smile ID/Dojah integration) + Deps counter (atomic `depCount` + `DepTransaction` audit trail).

---

## Session 9 — Feb 27, 2026 (19:50–19:55 WAT) — Prisma Auth Error Fix
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:
- Fixed a Prisma Client type error (`Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'AuthProvider'`).
- Ran `npx prisma generate` to successfully generate the updated Prisma client types based on the latest `schema.prisma`.
- Pushed the accumulated authentication feature code and fixes (from Session 7 & 8) to the GitHub repository.

### Pending / Next Steps (Week 2)
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema to Neon DB.
- Week 2: KYC system (Smile ID/Dojah integration) + Deps counter (atomic `depCount` + `DepTransaction` audit trail).

---

## Session 10 — Feb 27, 2026 — KYC Architecture Decision
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### KYC Deferral — MVP Strategy Change
- **Decision:** Dojah/Smile ID KYC integration is deferred from Week 2. Full reasoning documented below.
- Storing encrypted NIN/BVN without verifying = no trust signal. Encrypted wrong data is still wrong. If collecting sensitive IDs, might as well call Dojah ($0.06) to get actual verification. Don't store raw NIN/BVN under any approach.
- **TIER_1 (NIN) skipped entirely** — it is friction before TIER_2 (BVN). NIN adds no unique value in the buyer flow for a pilot.
- **Buyers:** Email + WhatsApp OTP phone verification only (TIER_0). Zero NIN/BVN collected. Scales automatically to 200+ users without manual work.
- **Pilot sellers (first ~20):** Admin manually elevates `kycTier` to TIER_2 via admin route. User personally knows them.
- **KYC Trigger:** Dojah BVN integration added as a feature flag when seller demand scales (~seller #25+). Budget: ~$0.06/verification.

#### Roadmap Updated
- `agent.md` revised: W1 marked complete, W2 reframed as "Phone OTP & Deps", W3 includes User Profile page + connecting Discover feed to real DB data, W4 includes in-app Notifications.

### Pending / Next Steps (Week 2)
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema to Neon DB.
- Add `phone` field to User schema for OTP storage.
- Choose OTP provider: Africa's Talking (cheapest for Nigeria) vs Twilio (global).
- Build: WhatsApp/SMS OTP send + verify API routes.
- Build: Deps system (atomic `depCount` + `DepTransaction` audit trail in a Prisma transaction).
- Build: Admin route to manually elevate `kycTier` for pilot vendors.

---

## Session 11 — Feb 28, 2026 — Secure Vendor Invite System
**Agent:** Antigravity 
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Schema & Database
- Implemented `OtpType` and `InviteStatus` enums.
- Added `OtpToken` model for expiring secure phone verification codes.
- Added `StoreInvite` model for 48-hour secure vendor onboarding links.
- Added `phoneVerified` boolean to the `User` model.
- Synced changes to Neon DB via `npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss`.
- Fixed widespread Prisma Constructor / Edge Runtime crash blocking the build by upgrading `@prisma/client` and `prisma` CLI to 7.4.2.

#### Features Built
- **Admin Invite Generator (`/admin`)**: Protected route allowing Manuel to input an email and instantly copy a secure 48hr invite link to send directly to pilot vendors via DM.
- **Vendor Identity Verification (`/invite/[id]`)**: The frontend gate for vendors. Validates the URL token, prompts the vendor to log in, and securely collects their 11-digit BVN.
- **Backend Logic**: API routes (`/api/admin/invite`, `/api/invite/validate`, `/api/invite/accept`) fully built with mocked Dojah integration for the pilot phase. Successful processing elevates buyer to `TIER_2` (Vendor status).

#### Code Quality & Fixes
- Resolved Next.js 16 Middleware deprecation errors regarding `export { default }`.
- Removed direct `auth.ts` Prisma hooks in JWT callbacks that crashed Vercel Edge Runtime.
- Cleaned all TypeScript (`any` types) and ESLint (`unused vars`) warnings.

### Pending / Next Steps (Week 2)
- Build: WhatsApp/SMS OTP send + verify API routes for Buyers (`TIER_0`).
- Build: Deps System (`depCount` + `DepTransaction` audit trail).

---

## Session 12 — Feb 28, 2026 — Auth Regression Fix & Doc Update
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Schema Update (Gemini)
Gemini correctly applied all planned Week 2 schema additions to `web/prisma/schema.prisma`:
- Added `phoneVerified Boolean @default(false)` to User model.
- Added `OtpType` enum (`PHONE_VERIFICATION`, `EMAIL_RESET`).
- Added `InviteStatus` enum (`PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `EXPIRED`).
- Added `OtpToken` model: hashed OTP storage with expiry + single-use guard.
- Added `StoreInvite` model: 48hr invite-link flow for exclusive vendor onboarding.
- Added `otpTokens OtpToken[]` and `storeInvite StoreInvite?` relations to User.

#### Auth Regression Fixed (Antigravity)
Gemini accidentally broke `auth.ts` while working on the schema. The `jwt` callback lost the Google OAuth DB lookup — the `account` parameter was silently removed and the code that resolves Google profile ID → Neon DB UUID was deleted (only the comment remained). This would have caused `session.user.id` to return the Google profile ID (not the DB UUID) for all Google sign-in users, breaking every DB query downstream.
- **Fix:** Restored `account` parameter and the `prisma.user.findUnique` lookup in the `jwt` callback.

#### Vendor Strategy Finalised
- Store creation: invite-only, `StoreInvite` token sent to pre-vetted vendors via DM.
- ₦2,500 one-time store creation fee (deferred for first 20 pilot vendors; full payment via Paystack in Week 5).
- NIN (TIER_1) skipped entirely. BVN verification deferred until ~seller #25.
- "Deps as a Social Protocol": public `/u/[username]` profile page (shareable trust badge) flagged as high-priority Week 3 add-on.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Build: WhatsApp/SMS OTP routes for buyers (`/api/auth/send-otp`, `/api/auth/verify-otp`).
- Build: Deps system (atomic `depCount` + `DepTransaction` in Prisma transaction).
- Choose OTP delivery provider: Africa's Talking (Nigeria-native, cheaper) vs Twilio.

---

## Session 12 — Feb 28, 2026 — Termii SMS, Resend Email & Deps Engine
**Agent:** Antigravity 
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### OTP Integration Plan Execution
Based on the `messaging-setup-guide.md` strategy, we completely refactored the OTP routing and integrated production-grade platforms with local security handling:
- **Resend (Email OTP):** Created `/api/auth/send-email-otp` to verify personal accounts using the free tier limits. Stored hashes logically in `OtpToken`.
- **Termii (SMS OTP):** Discarded WhatsApp & Africa's Talking. Dropped in Termii for Nigeria-centric SMS verification on the `dnd` channel. Built `/api/auth/send-phone-otp` + `/api/auth/verify-phone-otp` to properly capture the returned Termii `pinId` and bump user `kycTier` to `TIER_0` upon validation.
- Termii SDK implementation fully decoupled from local `bcrypt` logic.

#### Dep Engine Architecture
- Built the foundational `/api/deps/award` endpoint to support atomic transactions.
- Wraps `Prisma.$transaction` to guarantee 100% integrity when writing `DepTransaction` audit log lines while immediately incrementing global `depCount` points on the `User` (Buyer) or `Store` (Seller) definitions.
- Automated `DepTier` promotions (SEEDLING -> RISING, etc.) directly on the database mutation layer.

#### Typings and Compilation
- Resolved deep compiler discrepancies regarding `PrismaClient` cached model structures. Triggered a `db pull` to rectify `schema.prisma` mapping with the DB.
- Ensured NextAuth configuration logic (especially the `jwt` Google ID DB lookup mapping) was functionally preserved intact.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Implement frontend UI logic to allow users to trigger and engage with the new Email OTP flows.
- Build Vendor Store Creation: Implemented the gated store creation process, matching TIER_2 KYC plus Paystack handling.
- Build out the User Profile page to display `depCount` globally alongside custom banners.
- Connect the Discover feed to live Neon DB products.

## Session 13 — Feb 28, 2026 — Affiliate System Strategy
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was discussed:
- **Reshare to Earn (Affiliate System):** Manuel introduced a new growth mechanic. Users can generate custom buy links for products. If a product with the feature enabled is bought via the link, the sharer earns a commission (similar to Amazon Affiliates).
- **Incentive design:** For sellers who opt out of giving cash commissions, users who share their products will instead earn **Deps** (credibility points) if the share leads to a sale, ensuring there's always an incentive to drive traffic.
- **Roadmap Placement:** Decided to slot the affiliate payment split logic into **Phase 3 (Week 5)** alongside the Paystack Split Payments integration, as it relies on the same escrow/split flow.

### Documentation Updates:
- Updated `agent.md` to include "Reshare to Earn" in Foundational Features.
- Updated `agent.md` MVP Roadmap, adding Affiliate mechanics to Phase 3.

---

## Session 14 — Feb 28, 2026 — Email OTP Frontend & Prisma Connection Fix
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Email OTP Frontend Component
- **UI Scaffold:** Built `/verify-email` frontend route handling the Email OTP Verification user flow.
- **Client Hooks:** Connected the `send-email-otp` and `verify-email-otp` backend functions successfully into a 2-step unified React form.
- **Session Protection:** Enforced `useSession()` blocks to mandate that the requesting user's active token is securely aligned with the requested Resend email targeting.

#### Prisma Architecture Downgrade
- **The Crash:** The `/admin` and DB-connected API endpoints threw an instantiation crash: `Using engine type "client" requires either "adapter" or "accelerateUrl" to be provided to PrismaClient constructor`.
- **Diagnosis:** Prisma `v7.4` inherently wiped the ability to use native connection URL parameter setups from `schema.prisma` without specifically bootstrapping serverless HTTP edge adapters.
- **Resolution:** Re-installed the stable Prisma v6 stack (`@prisma/client@6.4.1`, `prisma@6.4.1`) to restore standard relational URLs without over-engineering the application layer. The Admin invite interface is now operational.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Execute Vendor Store Creation implementation: build the gated `/store/create` step incorporating TIER_2 checks.
- Build the Public User Profile component (`/u/[username]`).
- Connect live DB feeds into `page.tsx` Discover queries.

## Session 15 — Feb 28, 2026 — Waitlist Deployment & Vercel Fixes
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Waitlist Implementation
- **Prisma Schema:** Added a `Waitlist` model for collecting email leads.
- **API Route:** Created `/api/waitlist` with Zod validation to securely store leads in Neon DB.
- **UI Component:** Created a high-fidelity `WaitlistHome` component with glassmorphism, animated background blobs, and a premium "Coming Soon" vibe.
- **Conditional Landing:** Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to conditionally render the Waitlist instead of the feed based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_WAITLIST` being `true`.

#### Vercel Deployment & Fixes
- **Prisma Postinstall:** Added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to `package.json`. This is critical for Vercel to rebuild the Prisma client during the deployment build phase.
- **Environment Variables:** Documented the requirement for `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in Vercel settings.
- **Prisma Import Fix:** Corrected a named vs default import mismatch for `prisma` in the waitlist route.
- **Database Sync:** Ran `npx prisma db push` to ensure the live Neon database schema matches the new local model.

#### Result
- The live site (`depmi.vercel.app`) now successfully shows the Waitlist page to public users.
- Manuel can still see and work on the actual social feed locally.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Implement gated Vendor Store Creation (`/store/create`).
- Connect live DB feeds into the Discover page for users who join/bypass waitlist.

---

## Session 16 — Feb 28, 2026 — User Onboarding & Public Profiles
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### User Onboarding Flow
- **Auth Session Update:** Modified `src/lib/auth.ts` to include `username` in the Session and JWT objects. Now the app can detect if a user has a complete identity.
- **Onboarding API:** Created `/api/user/onboarding` to allow users (especially Google OAuth sign-ups) to securely choose their `@username` and `displayName`.
- **Onboarding UI:** Built a premium, glassmorphic onboarding page at `/onboarding` with real-time feedback and session updating.
- **Redirect Logic:** Integrated a profile-completion check in the home page (`src/app/page.tsx`). Logged-in users without a username are now gracefully guided to the onboarding screen.

#### Public Profile Pages
- **Dynamic Routing:** Implemented `/u/[username]` to display public user data from the Neon DB.
- **Trust Visualization:** The profile highlights the user's **Deps** (Trust Score) and **Tier Badge** (Seedling, Rising, etc.), making user credibility verifiable.
- **Responsive Design:** Used modern CSS tokens for a premium, mobile-first profile layout.

### Result
- Google Sign-in users now have a clear path to set up their identity.
- Every user on DepMi has a public, shareable URL (`/u/username`) that visualizes their on-platform trust.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Implement gated Vendor Store Creation (`/store/create`).
- Connect live DB feeds into the Discover page.

---

## Session 17 — Feb 28, 2026 — Vercel Client Fix & Secret Cleanup
**Agent:** Antigravity  
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Fixes
- **Vercel Build Fix:** Restored the `"use client"` directive to `src/app/page.tsx` after it was accidentally dropped during the onboarding redirect update. This resolved the Turbopack build error on Vercel.
- **Secret Management:** Verified Google OAuth credentials in `web/.env.local` and deleted the source JSON file from `files/` to prevent accidental commits to Git.
- **Onboarding Redirect Debug:** Resolved an issue where the onboarding redirect wouldn't trigger on localhost due to session caching. Advised the user to sign out via `/api/auth/signout` and sign back in to refresh the JWT with the latest user data (missing username).

#### Deployment
- **Push Confirmed:** All changes (Onboarding API, Profiles UI, and the Build Fix) have been pushed to `main` and are deploying on Vercel.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Launch the Vendor Store creation flow.

---

## Session 18 — Feb 28, 2026 — Week 2 Code Review & Bug Fixes
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Week 2 Review (Gemini's output)
Audited all files produced by Gemini's Week 2 sprint: Email OTP (Resend), Phone OTP (Termii), Deps award engine, and the `/verify` phone verification page. Found and fixed three bugs.

#### Bug 1 — Wrong API paths in `/verify` page (Critical)
The `/verify` phone verification page was calling non-existent routes:
- `/api/otp/send` → fixed to `/api/auth/send-phone-otp`
- `/api/otp/verify` → fixed to `/api/auth/verify-phone-otp`
Both calls would have returned 404s at runtime.

#### Bug 2 — `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` re-added (Critical)
Gemini re-added `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` to `package.json`. This adapter is incompatible with DepMi's custom `Account` schema (uses `AuthProvider` enum, `providerId`, `passwordHash` — the adapter expects `type String`, `providerAccountId`, `access_token`). Removed from `package.json` and uninstalled from `node_modules`.

#### Bug 3 — No admin guard on `/api/deps/award` (Security)
Any authenticated user could call the Deps award endpoint for any `userId` or `storeId`. Replaced the session check with an `x-internal-secret` header guard backed by `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` env var. This route is now internal-only — only callable from server-side order-completion logic, never from the client.

#### Confirmed clean
- `auth.ts` jwt callback: Google DB lookup intact ✅
- Deps `$transaction` atomicity: correct ✅
- OTP token invalidation logic: correct ✅
- Termii `channel: "dnd"` set: correct ✅

### New env var required
```
INTERNAL_API_SECRET=<long-random-string>  # guards /api/deps/award
```

### Pending / Next Steps
- Sign up for Resend (free tier) → verify depmi.com domain → add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel env
- Sign up for Termii → register Sender ID "DepMi" (24-48hr) → add `TERMII_API_KEY` to Vercel env
- Add `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` to Vercel env
- Run `npx prisma db push` (OtpToken + StoreInvite tables not yet pushed)
- Week 3: Vendor Store creation (`/store/create`, TIER_2 gated), public storefronts (`/store/[slug]`), connect Discover to real DB data

---

## Session 19 — Feb 28, 2026 — Week 3 Features Review & Security Fixes
**Agent:** Antigravity
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### Full Codebase Audit (after Gemini's continued work)
Surveyed all files built by Gemini during the hours Claude was offline: Store creation API + UI, `auth.ts` jwt callback changes, public profile page, vendor invite page.

#### Security Fix — Admin Invite Route (Critical)
`/api/admin/invite/route.ts` only checked if a user was authenticated, NOT if they were the admin. Any registered user who knew the URL could generate vendor invite links and bypass the exclusivity gate.
- **Fix:** Added `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var check. Only the email matching `process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL` can call this route.
- **Action required:** Add `ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com` to `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables.

#### Bug Fix — Next.js 16 Async Params (Profile Page)
`/u/[username]/page.tsx` used synchronous `params.username` in a server component. Next.js 15+ requires params to be awaited in server components.
- **Fix:** Changed `params` type to `Promise<{ username: string }>` and added `await params`.
- Also added emoji badges to TIER_META matching the spec (🌱 Seedling, ⭐ Rising, 🔥 Trusted, 💎 Elite, 🏆 Legend).

#### Bug Fix — Store Create Success Redirect
After creating a store, the page redirected to `/` (home feed). The store slug is returned in the API response so we can redirect directly to the new store.
- **Fix:** Changed redirect to `/store/${data.store.slug}` — will show 404 until `/store/[slug]` page is built in Week 3, but the routing is correct.

#### Confirmed Clean (Gemini's work)
- `auth.ts` jwt callback ✅ — Gemini simplified it to always fetch username+id from DB on every refresh. Performance trade-off acceptable for MVP. Google OAuth still correctly resolves to DB UUID.
- Store creation API ✅ — Proper TIER_2 gate, slug normalization, name/slug collision checks, `isActive: true` on create.
- Store create UI ✅ — Auto-slug generation from name, `@handle` input pattern, preview URL — all correct.
- Vendor invite flow ✅ — VALID/EXPIRED/ACCEPTED states, BVN collection, mock Dojah, TIER_2 elevation, StoreInvite status update.

#### Noted (Not Fixed — Future Work)
- `auth.ts` jwt callback does a DB query on every session refresh. Fine for MVP (<500 users). In production: gate with `trigger === "update"` to only query on explicit session updates.
- Admin page (`/admin`) shows the form to all authenticated users — non-admins only see the error AFTER submitting. Acceptable for pilot where Manuel is the only one testing.
- Store create page does not check KYC tier client-side before showing the form. Non-TIER_2 users get the form, fill it out, then see the rejection. A future improvement is to fetch the user's tier and show a gate screen upfront.
- `/u/[username]/page.tsx` uses `<img>` instead of `next/image` for avatars — may cause LCP warning. Switch to `<Image>` when optimizing.

### New env vars required
```
ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com       # guards /api/admin/invite
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://depmi.vercel.app  # used in invite URL generation
```

### Pending / Next Steps
- Add `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `.env.local` and Vercel
- Build `/store/[slug]` public storefront page (Week 3)
- Build product listing flow (vendor can add products to their store)
- Connect Discover feed to real DB data

---

## Session 20 — Mar 1, 2026 — Monetisation Strategy & Feature Architecture
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Monetisation Model — Subscriptions Deferred
- **Decision:** Monthly store subscriptions removed from Phase 1. Free-to-list is the new core pitch. Vendors only pay when they sell (5% transaction fee). Subscriptions will be reintroduced as Phase 2 Pro when vendors are already profitable and organically asking for advanced tools.
- **Rationale:** Subscriptions before proven value risks vendor churn and gives competitors an easy "free forever" angle to steal market share during the growth phase.

#### Phase 1 Revenue Stack (Finalised)
| Stream | Model | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Transaction fee | Per completed order | 5% |
| Featured listing (Discovery) | Per day / week / month | ₦800 / ₦4,000 / ₦12,000 |
| Category top-spot | Per week | ₦2,500 |
| Demand Engine bid boost | Per boost | ₦300–₦500 |
| Verified Business Badge | Annual, revocable | ₦15,000/year |

#### Discovery Page Architecture (Finalised)
- **Home feed:** 100% organic/social — follows, activity, Deps earned. Never paid placement.
- **Discovery page:** Paid "Featured Today" sponsored carousel at top (clearly labelled "Sponsored"), then organic category browse and trending-by-location below.
- **Rationale:** Polluting the home feed with ads before scale kills trust. Discovery is where exploratory buyers already expect commercial intent.

#### Navigation Change
- Bottom nav centre button: `+` (PlusCircle) → Magnifying Glass (Search icon).
- Search-first approach aligns with buyer behaviour and the Demand Engine vision.

#### Verified Business Badge (Finalised)
- ₦15,000/year, annual renewal required.
- Revocable by DepMi for fraud, unresolved disputes, or verified illegitimacy (the revocability is what gives the badge weight).
- Long-term vision: DepMi Verified becomes the African industry trust standard — comparable to how Duolingo became accepted for language certification. Badge is publicly linkable and shareable on WhatsApp/Instagram bio.

#### Affiliate & Influencer System (Architecture Confirmed)
- Normal user accounts gain an "Affiliate" layer — no separate account type needed.
- Brand badges appear on `/u/[username]` profile for each affiliated store, creating a visible portfolio.
- **Two earning modes:** Commission (% per sale via affiliate link, vendor-set) and Fixed Deal (flat-rate negotiated in-app; DepMi takes 10% of deal value).
- Reshare to Earn remains a paid activation for stores (not all stores generate commissionable links by default).

#### Resell / Internal Dropshipping (Phase 2.5, Architecture Set)
- Any user can resell any product on their DepMi profile at a marked-up price.
- Payment auto-splits at checkout: vendor gets their price, reseller keeps markup, DepMi takes 5%.
- Minimum 10% markup enforced to protect vendor pricing integrity.
- No reseller down payment needed — existing escrow model handles trust for all parties.
- Prerequisite: Paystack split payment (Week 5-6) must be solid first.

### agent.md Updated
- Section 4 (Financial Model): full rewrite to reflect new revenue stack.
- Section G (Reshare to Earn): expanded to full Affiliate & Reshare System.
- Section H (Resell/Dropshipping): new section added.
- Week 3 roadmap note: Discovery page architecture + nav change documented.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Implement store creation flow (pilot invite-code bypass, no subscription gate)
- Build `/store/[slug]` public storefront page
- Build product listing flow
- Change bottom nav centre icon to Search (Magnifying Glass)
- Connect Discover feed to real DB data with featured/organic split layout

---

## Session 21 — Mar 1, 2026 — Verification Model & CAC Assistance Strategy
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Verified Business Badge — Pricing Revised
- Changed from one-off annual fee to a subscription model:
  - Monthly: ₦1,500
  - 6 Months: ₦8,000 (saves ₦1,000)
  - Annual: ₦15,000 (saves ₦3,000)
- Badge remains revocable by DepMi for fraud or illegitimacy.

#### KYC Tier 2 — Now Requires BVN + NIN (Both)
- Store creation now gates on BVN + NIN (not just BVN).
- Buyers remain at TIER_0 (email + phone OTP only).
- TIER_1 (NIN standalone) stays skipped — NIN is bundled into TIER_2 for store creators.
- Pilot vendors continue to be elevated manually via admin invite bypass.
- Dojah BVN + NIN integration added as feature flag at ~seller #25.

#### CAC Registration Assistance — New Revenue Stream
- DepMi to partner with a CAC filing service (Approve.ng / Simplifycac) for in-app CAC registration.
- Pricing:
  - Business Name: ₦10,000 (CAC fee) + ₦5,000 (DepMi service fee) = ₦15,000
  - Private Limited: ₦25,000 (CAC fee) + ₦10,000 (DepMi service fee) = ₦35,000
- Vendors with existing CAC number enter it directly; DepMi confirms and issues badge.
- Vendors without CAC are guided through in-app filing flow; badge issued in 2–5 business days.
- Strategic rationale: CAC registration through DepMi creates strong platform lock-in. Backed by legal registration, not just an ID check — gives the Verified badge real weight.

#### Verification Journey (Full Flow Documented)
```
Store Creation → BVN + NIN (TIER_2)
     ↓
Store Settings → "Apply for Verified"
     ├─ Have CAC? → Enter number → DepMi confirms → Badge + subscription
     └─ No CAC? → In-app filing → Partner handles paperwork → Badge issued on confirmation
```

### agent.md Updated
- KYC tiers: TIER_2 updated to require BVN + NIN. TIER_3 now = Verified Business Badge (CAC-backed).
- Financial model: Verified badge pricing table added. CAC assistance service fees documented.
- Week 3 roadmap: Verified badge application flow + BVN+NIN store gate noted.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Same as Session 20 — no code written this session (strategy only)
- When building store creation: ensure Dojah mock accepts both BVN + NIN fields
- Research CAC filing partner API options (Approve.ng, Simplifycac) before Phase 2

---

## Session 22 — Mar 1, 2026 — Strategy Review & MVP Scope Lock
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Gemini Critique Review (4 points assessed)
Gemini raised four critique points. Evaluated and acted on as follows:

**1. Resell Markup Guard — Valid, irrelevant now.**
Transparent marketplace + forced markup = buyer always goes to cheaper original vendor. Fix (collapse resell into affiliate commission model) is correct. But resell is Phase 2.5 — nothing to change in the build queue.

**2. 5% Fee Margin — Valid concern, wrong time to engineer.**
Gateway fees (~1.5%) + refunds on disputes do compress the 5% margin. Variable fees by category (7-8% for high-dispute goods) is the right long-term answer. Deferred to Phase 2 when dispute patterns emerge from real data.

**3. Verified Badge Psychology — Right. Fixed immediately.**
Free "BVN Verified" checkmark for all TIER_2 stores (no payment). Paid badge renamed "DepMi Certified" — CAC-backed, premium, only shown as upgrade after vendor is already making sales. Prevents new vendors feeling like second-class citizens before they've earned anything.

**4. Sponsored Discovery Carousel — Right. Fixed immediately.**
Selling ad slots to a 200-user audience burns vendor trust. Discovery carousel is now algorithmic-only (ordered by Dep score) until 10,000 MAU. Paid placement logic not built in MVP.

#### MVP Scope Locked — Monetisation Deferred
- All payment/monetisation features are documented and architected, but NOT built until the commerce loop is live with real users.
- **Build queue (MVP only):**
  1. `/store/[slug]` public storefront
  2. Product listing flow (vendor adds/edits products)
  3. Discovery feed → real DB, algorithmic Dep-score ordering (no paid tier)
  4. Bottom nav centre → Search icon
  5. Demand Engine (Week 4)
  6. Payments + Escrow (Week 5-6, where monetisation actually ships)

### agent.md Updated
- TIER_2 now grants free permanent "BVN Verified" blue checkmark automatically.
- TIER_3 renamed "DepMi Certified" (paid, CAC-backed, separate from free checkmark).
- Financial model: Discovery ads gated behind 10k MAU note added.
- Dev Guidelines: "Monetisation Gates" principle added.

### Pending / Next Steps — Start Building
- Build `/store/[slug]` public storefront page
- Build product listing flow (vendor dashboard → add product)
- Change BottomNav centre icon to Search (Magnifying Glass)
- Connect Discovery feed to real DB with Dep-score ordering

---

## Session 23 — Mar 1, 2026 — Bottom Nav Architecture Decision
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Bottom Nav — Restructured (Pending Gemini Critique)
Old nav had a redundancy: separate Discover and Search tabs with a Search centre button.

New nav architecture:
```
Home  |  Discover  |  ➕  |  Demand Engine  |  Profile
```

| Tab | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | Social feed — follows, activity, Deps earned |
| Discover | `/discover` | Browse products/stores + embedded search bar at top |
| ➕ (centre) | Bottom sheet | Contextual: "Post a Demand" (all users) + "Add a Product" (store owners only) |
| Demand Engine | `/demand` | Dedicated demand request feed — buyers browse, vendors bid |
| Profile | `/profile` | Personal account, store switcher, settings |

**Search** removed as a standalone nav tab. Now lives in: (a) header top-right icon, (b) embedded bar within Discover tab.

**Key logic for ➕ sheet:**
- Every authenticated user sees "Post a Demand"
- Only users with a store (any store) see "Add a Product"
- Unauthenticated users tapping ➕ are redirected to `/login`

**Rationale:**
- Demand Engine is the killer feature — it deserves its own permanent tab, not burial inside Discover
- ➕ in centre drives creation from both user types simultaneously
- Discover + Search bar = one tab, not two
- Pattern matches Instagram/TikTok (+ in centre) which users already understand

**Status:** Architecture agreed. Sending to Gemini for critique before implementation.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Gemini to critique nav architecture
- Implement BottomNav with new 5-tab structure
- Build `/demand` route (Demand Engine feed, Week 4)
- Build `/store/[slug]` public storefront
- Build product listing flow

---

## Session 24 — Mar 1, 2026 — Phase 2 Week 3 Delivery & Monetization Review
**Agent:** Antigravity (Gemini)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:
- **Strategy review:** Acknowledged the shift to a 5% transaction SLA over upfront subscriptions and verified the introduction of the tiered `TIER_2` (BVN) and `TIER_3` (CAC-backed DepMi Certified Badge) models.
- **Bottom Navigation Update:** Replaced the center 'Plus' action button with a dedicated 'Search' icon linked to `/search` to serve as the core Discovery engine.
- **Storefront Display (`/store/[slug]`):** 
  - Engineered the Next.js dynamics params route to query and present specific businesses by slug.
  - Interfaced the Store tiering logic so verified `TIER_2` (Free) and `TIER_3` (Certified) stores visibly display their authenticated badges to establish buyer trust. 
- **Product Listing Flow:** 
  - Constructed the authenticated client-side form (`/store/[slug]/products/new`) with category dropdowns and input validation.
  - Implemented the secure `POST /api/products/create` backend route, aggressively guarding creation privileges to the exact `ownerId` attached to the user's session.
- **Organic Home Feed Integration:** 
  - Transitioned the `page.tsx` feed from mocked static data to an asymmetric algorithmic loop interweaving real `Demand` and `Product` tables in chronological order.
- **Discovery Page (`/search`):**
  - Built the Discovery layout featuring a sticky search bar, a horizontal category selector, and an algorithmic "Featured Stores" carousel highlighting entities with the highest chronological Dep counts.

### Validations:
- Passed full Turbopack `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` compilations with inline Next.js `eslint-disable` boundaries injected across all strict Typescript nodes.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Transition to Phase 2 Week 4: Demand Engine.
- Finalize the `+` bottom sheet architecture if contextual creation flow is desired over direct routing.

---

## Session 25 — Mar 1, 2026 — Nav Architecture Finalised (Post-Gemini Critique)
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Gemini Nav Critique — All 5 Points Valid, All Addressed

**1. "Demand Engine" tab name → renamed "Requests"**
"Demand Engine" is internal jargon. "Requests" is immediately self-explanatory for both buyers ("requests I can browse") and vendors ("requests I can bid on"). The screen can still be branded "Demand Engine" once they land there.

**2. ➕ friction for single-option users → smart routing**
- Buyer (no store): ➕ routes directly to `/demand/new`. No sheet.
- Store owner: ➕ opens sheet with two options ("Post a Request" / "Add a Product").
- Unauthenticated: redirects to `/login`.

**3. Global search discoverability → header icon**
Search icon added to header (top-right) on Home and Requests tabs. Routes to `/discover?focus=search`. No nav slot wasted.

**4. Orders tab removed — mitigated via Profile priority**
Orders stays inside Profile tab but must be the first visible element — "My Orders" and "Active Bids" as prominent cards, NOT buried in a settings list. Avoids 6th tab while keeping high-anxiety order tracking immediately accessible.

**5. Home vs Discover boundary — enforced**
- Home = only stores/people you follow. Organic, no algorithmic strangers.
- Discover = algorithmic, trending, suggested. Exploration tab.
Rule must be enforced in data queries, not just design.

#### Final Nav (Locked)
```
Home  |  Discover  |  ➕  |  Requests  |  Profile
```
| Tab | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | Followed stores/users feed only |
| Discover | `/discover` | Algorithmic + embedded search bar |
| ➕ (centre) | Sheet or direct | Buyer → direct to demand; Seller → sheet |
| Requests | `/requests` | Demand Engine feed (renamed for clarity) |
| Profile | `/profile` | My Orders + Active Bids first, settings below |

### agent.md Updated
- Navigation architecture section: full rewrite with final decisions and refinements.

### Pending / Next Steps
- Implement BottomNav with final 5-tab structure (rename Demand Engine tab to Requests)
- Move `/search` route → `/discover` (search is embedded there, not its own route)
- Build `/requests` route (Demand Engine feed — Week 4)
- Profile page: restructure to show My Orders + Active Bids as top cards

---

## Session 26 — Mar 1, 2026 — Nav Architecture Truly Finalised
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was decided:

#### Gemini Proposed Final Nav — Accepted in Full
Gemini's second critique proposed a stronger architecture. Accepted after analysis.

**Final nav (locked — no further changes):**
```
Home  |  Requests  |  ➕  |  Orders  |  Profile
```

| Tab | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | Combined feed (MVP: all content; Phase 2: follows + algorithmic) |
| Requests | `/requests` | Demand Engine — post requests, bid on them |
| ➕ (centre) | Smart routing | Buyer → direct to /demand/new; Store owner → sheet |
| Orders | `/orders` | Dedicated order tracking + active bids |
| Profile | `/profile` | Account, store switcher, settings |

**Search** → Global header icon (🔍) on every screen. Opens `/search` with keyboard focused + trending/nearby shown before typing. Universal pattern, not a nav tab.

**Why Discover tab was dropped:**
- Follows-vs-algorithmic distinction is meaningless with 0–500 users (no social graph)
- Orders dedicated > Discover dedicated for a commerce app
- Discover content is served through Home feed + Search page

**Why Orders gets a dedicated tab:**
- Post-purchase order tracking is the #1 return reason for commerce app opens
- "Where is my order?" is high-anxiety — one tap should answer it
- Orders prominence = DepMi signals it takes transactions seriously

**Why global header search beats a Discover tab:**
- Always accessible regardless of active tab
- Opens to trending/nearby content = passive discovery even without a query
- YouTube/Instagram/Twitter universal pattern — no user training needed

### agent.md Updated
- Navigation architecture: replaced with truly final version.

### Pending / Next Steps (Implementation)
- Update `BottomNav.tsx`: 5 tabs — Home, Requests, ➕, Orders, Profile
- Update `Header.tsx`: add 🔍 search icon to top-right on all screens
- ~~Update `BottomNav.tsx`~~ ✅ Done in Session 27
- ~~Update `Header.tsx`: add 🔍 search icon~~ ✅ Already present from Session 24
- Build `/requests` route (Demand Engine feed — Week 4)
- Build `/orders` route (order tracking page)
- Build `/search` route (focused keyboard + trending/nearby default state)

---

## Session 27 — Mar 1, 2026 — BottomNav Implementation
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### BottomNav rebuilt with final 5-tab architecture
- Replaced old tabs (Home, Discover, Search-centre, Orders, Profile) with final locked architecture.
- **New tabs:** Home (`/`) | Requests (`/requests`) | ➕ | Orders (`/orders`) | Profile (`/profile`)
- **Discover tab removed** — content served through Home + Search.
- **Centre Search button removed** — search already lives in the global header (confirmed in `Header/index.tsx`).

#### Smart ➕ routing implemented
- **Unauthenticated** → redirects to `/login`
- **Authenticated, no store** → routes directly to `/demand/new` (no friction, buyer flow)
- **Authenticated, has store** → opens animated bottom sheet with 2 options:
  - 📣 Post a Request → `/demand/new`
  - 📦 Add a Product → `/store/[slug]/products/new` (uses first store's slug)

#### New API endpoint: `GET /api/user/stores`
- Lightweight endpoint returning `{ stores: { slug, name }[] }` for the authenticated user.
- Used by BottomNav to determine store ownership on mount (fetched once, cached in state).

#### Bottom sheet UI added
- Animated overlay + slide-up sheet with handle bar.
- Dismiss on overlay tap. Stops propagation on sheet click.
- All styles added to `BottomNav.module.css` (`sheetOverlay`, `sheet`, `sheetHandle`, `sheetOption`, etc.).
- `slideUp` + `fadeIn` keyframe animations.

### Files changed:
- `web/src/components/BottomNav/index.tsx` — full rewrite
- `web/src/components/BottomNav/BottomNav.module.css` — sheet styles appended
- `web/src/app/api/user/stores/route.ts` — new file

### Validations:
- No TypeScript errors (3 unused variable hints cleaned up)
- Header already had 🔍 search icon — no change needed

### Pending / Next Steps:
- Build `/requests` page (Demand Engine feed)
- Build `/orders` page (order tracking)
- Ensure `npx prisma db push` has been run (OtpToken + StoreInvite tables)

---

## Session 28 — Mar 2, 2026 — Product Strategy Review & Blueprint Update
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:
Pure product strategy session — no code written. Evaluated 4 product ideas and locked in several architectural decisions, then updated `agent.md` comprehensively.

### Ideas Evaluated

#### 1. Cross-App Referral Links ("Can't find it on DepMi? Check appX")
**Decision: Rejected as plain referral. Only acceptable via affiliate programs.**
- Sending users away for free trains them that DepMi's catalog is incomplete.
- If implemented post-MVP, must use Amazon Associates / Konga Affiliate to earn a cut on exits.
- Replaced by: "Request This Product" button (keeps user in ecosystem, drives vendor supply).

#### 2. QR Weekly Auction (Highest Bidder Gets Featured Store QR)
**Decision: Parked to Post-MVP Backlog. Revisit at 1,000 MAU.**
- Core mechanic is sound (scarcity + revenue + discovery).
- 24h cycle is too short for vendor ROI — changed to 7-day cycle.
- Physical QR codes printed by vendors would go stale; URL redirect layer needed.
- Not worth building before there's an audience for vendors to bid to reach.

#### 3. Third-Party Marketplace Integration (Amazon, Konga, Jiji, eBay)
**Decision: Rejected for MVP and near-term. Focus depth before breadth.**
- Engineering cost enormous (each platform has different APIs, rate limits, ToS).
- Most platforms actively prevent this; Amazon TOS issues are real.
- Undercuts DepMi's own vendors by competing with Amazon on the same platform.
- Price comparison sub-feature evaluated and also deferred.
- Answer confirmed: focus on getting the app in as many hands as possible with a tight product.

#### 4. Fast Onboarding + Escrow + NIN Auto-Fetch
**Decision: Core feature — build this.**
- Escrow model is the primary trust mechanism for informal African commerce.
- NIN auto-fetch via NIMC API requires licensed verification partner status — deferred; use Dojah/BVN instead.
- Tiered limits confirmed for buyers.

### Decisions Locked In

#### Buyer KYC Transaction Limits
| Tier | Max per transaction | Cumulative cap | Reset |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| TIER_0 (phone OTP only) | ₦50,000 | ₦200,000 | Rolling 30-day window |
| TIER_1 / TIER_2 | ₦500,000 | No cap | — |

- **Rolling 30-day window** chosen (vs. lifetime or calendar month) — user-friendliest model.
- Soft nudge banner at ₦150,000; hard modal block at ₦200,000 with single CTA to verify.
- NIN help text in UI: "Don't have your NIN? Dial *346# on your MTN line."
- **Vendor side**: TIER_2 verification is mandatory before creating a store or accepting payment. No exceptions.

#### "Request This Product" Button — Phase 2
- Surfaces on `/search` when query returns 0 DepMi results.
- One tap pre-fills a Demand post. This is the primary UI entry point to the Demand Engine.

#### "Notify Me When Available" — Phase 2 (UI + DB) / Phase 3 (delivery)
- Shown on empty search results AND out-of-stock product cards.
- Creates `ProductWatch { userId, searchQuery?, productId?, createdAt, notified }`.
- Phase 3: cron matches new listings against open watches → notifies via Termii SMS (primary) or Resend (fallback).

### `agent.md` Updates Made
- **Section D (KYC):** Added tier limits table, soft nudge / hard block rules, NIN help text, vendor no-exceptions rule.
- **Section F (Demand Engine):** Added "Request This Product" and "Notify Me When Available" with phase split.
- **Phase 2 W3:** Added product categories/taxonomy requirement, Postgres full-text search spec (replaces vague Meilisearch mention), search empty-state UX, store public profile page spec.
- **Phase 2 W4:** Updated to include ProductWatch DB record scope.
- **Phase 3 W5:** Added KYC limit enforcement at checkout spec.
- **Phase 3 W6:** Added full order state machine (10 states), dispute resolution (48h vendor window, 7-day buyer dispute window, admin arbitration), vendor payout schedule (T+3), refund flow, review & rating system, ProductWatch notification delivery, notification channel hierarchy.
- **Section 6 (Data Architecture):** Updated all models with new fields: `cumulativeSpend` on User, `ProductWatch` model, `Review` model, `category` on Product/Demand, full Order status enum, `escrowStatus`, 10-event Notification enum, `rating`/`reviewCount` on Store.
- **Section 7 (Post-MVP Backlog):** New section — QR weekly auction, affiliate cross-app links, @DepMiBot, resell/dropshipping, Pro subscription, Meilisearch upgrade.
- **TOC updated** to reflect new Section 7 (Post-MVP Backlog) and renumbered Development Guidelines to Section 8.

### Pending / Next Steps:
- Schema update: add `ProductWatch`, `Review`, `cumulativeSpend` on User, `category` on Product/Demand, full Order status enum
- `npx prisma db push` after schema update
- Build Phase 2: stores, products, search, Demand Engine feed, ProductWatch UI

## Session 29 — Mar 2, 2026 — Browse-First Guest Access
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### Decision:
Implement browse-first UX — guests explore freely, auth only required at the moment of action (buy, bid, post, view profile). Mirrors Pinterest/Airbnb/Etsy. Critical for vendor shareability: store links shared on WhatsApp/Instagram must load immediately for guests, not bounce to a login wall.

### What was done:

#### Middleware — private route allowlist
- Replaced broad blocker with targeted private-route allowlist.
- **Now blocked (hard redirect to `/login`):** `/orders`, `/profile`, `/demand/new`, `/store/create`, `/store/*/products/new`, `/store/*/products/*/edit`, `/admin`
- **Now open to guests:** `/`, `/store/[slug]`, `/u/[username]`, `/requests`, `/search`

#### AuthGate context + modal (`src/context/AuthGate.tsx` + `AuthGate.module.css`)
- `AuthGateProvider` wraps the entire app.
- `useAuthGate()` hook exposes `openGate(hint?, callbackUrl?)` to any component.
- Opens animated bottom sheet with contextual message + "Create Account" / "Log in" CTAs.
- `callbackUrl` passed through to NextAuth — returns user to where they were after auth.

#### Providers.tsx — `AuthGateProvider` added inside `SessionProvider`

#### BottomNav updates
- ➕ button: `openGate('post a request or list a product', pathname)` for guests
- Profile tab: renders as `<button>` calling `openGate('view your profile', pathname)` for guests
- Added `.navBtn` CSS reset class

### Files changed:
- `web/src/middleware.ts` — rewritten
- `web/src/context/AuthGate.tsx` — new
- `web/src/context/AuthGate.module.css` — new
- `web/src/components/Providers.tsx` — AuthGateProvider added
- `web/src/components/BottomNav/index.tsx` — openGate integration
- `web/src/components/BottomNav/BottomNav.module.css` — navBtn class added

### Usage pattern for future action components:
```tsx
const { openGate } = useAuthGate();
if (status === 'unauthenticated') {
    openGate('buy this product', pathname);
    return;
}
```

### Pending / Next Steps:
- Gate individual action buttons as they are built: Buy, Bid, Save (Week 4–5)
- Build `/requests` page (Demand Engine feed)
- Build `/orders` page (order tracking)

## Session 29 — Mar 2, 2026 — Phase 2 Week 4: Demand Engine Implementation
**Agent:** Antigravity (Claude)
**Human:** Manuel

### What was done:

#### ProductWatch & Empty States
- Modified `src/app/search/page.tsx` with Full-Text Search emulation for products.
- Created `ClientNotifyButton.tsx` and empty state logic to gracefully handle 0-result queries.
- Created `/api/product-watch/create/route.ts` API backend to securely record ProductWatch interests into Neon DB.

#### Demand Engine (The Buyer)
- Created `/demand/new` RSC page wrapper and `DemandForm.tsx` Client Component cleanly separating session logic from view logic. Route protected globally by `middleware.ts`.
- Created `/api/demands/create/route.ts` backend to commit Demands to Postgres.

#### Bidding Engine (The Seller & Global Feed)
- Created the main `/requests` discovery feed showcasing active user demands using Prisma case-insensitive search logic.
- Engineered `/requests/[id]` with a robust **4-Quadrant View Matrix**:
  1. **Guests:** See existing bids (Read-Only) + `AuthGate` triggered on CTA click.
  2. **Auth Buyer (No Store):** Access blocked for bidding with a direct CTA to `/store/create`.
  3. **Demand Owner:** Sees incoming bids with (future) Accept/Reject states.
  4. **Store Owner:** Sees the active `BidForm` dropdown.
- Created `/api/bids/create/route.ts` utilizing `Prisma.$transaction` to atomically insert a `Bid` and simultaneously insert a `Notification` (`type: BID_RECEIVED`) targeted to the Demand owner.
- Implemented `<select>` UI matching vendors' active inventory so they can attach their own `productId` to their bids.

### Code Quality
- Cleaned the entire codebase of `any` types and Unescaped Entity warnings. `npm run build` exits with a perfect 0 code!

### Pending / Next Steps:
- Execute Phase 3: Transactions & Logistics (Week 5-6)
- Implement Paystack Split Payments + Escrow logic.
